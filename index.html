Opt for closed-toe shoes to protect your feet from dust and debris, especially in crowded areas. Ensure they have good arch support for long walks, and consider slip-on styles for easy removal when visiting temples or homes where shoes need to be taken off. Finally, choose shoes in neutral colors to blend in with the local culture and customs.
